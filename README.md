# ToDown
A markdown todo list

Because a normal todo list isn't nerdy enough

## Roadmap
  - [ ] Write more tests
    - [ ] enough tests to cover what I've written in code so far
  - [ ] Work on parsing
  - [ ] Work on being able to edit the document efficiently
    - aka not have the entire document update every time you type a letter
  - [ ] Create a markdown editor
    - [ ] Text editor
    - [ ] with preview
  - [ ] Add the `todo` plugin
  - [ ] Add user interaction to the markdown editor
  - [ ] Add ability to save or export
  - [ ] Add a file system
    - [ ] Add ability to export entire virtual filesystem
  - [ ] ???
  - [ ] Profit

## Is the scope of this project too big for one developer who's still in high school?
Yes.
